   I've never thought that I would create a CLI project all by myself.
		 
  At the beginning of CLI project week and after 2 weeks of learning the Ruby language I found myself in the position that I didn’t know where to start or how.

  I’ve decided to use an API for my project, one of the requirements was to  provide access to data for a web page. I new I needed some gems:   Net::HTTP to build HTTP user_agent. This will also require “uri” so you don’t need to require it separately and JSON  to parse the string I obtained by calling GET method.
 
 Beside that I knew that I might need to build a few classes, use all my knowledge I learned  on the past two weeks about variables, strings, array, hashes etc but I didn’t know how to start.
 
   Thinking and thinking I realized that my problem was that I didn’t know what I wanted from my CLI application .I started by writing  down few thoughts :


name -CLI project (Braking Bad TV Show-facts)

classes- (Class characters, Class CLI, Class API -add more classes if need it)

user input

https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation
1. greeting “Welcome!”

2. ask user if they want to see a list of characters(optional or display the list of characters in the same time with the greeting)

3. display the list characters of Breaking Bad TV show
4.ask user for input (what character )
5.display "character name " and ask the user again if they want to know some facts about the chosen character 
6.display the facts 
5.ask user again if they want to see some quotes from that character 
6.display the quotes 
7. option to chose another character or exit


After writing a few lines I felt like the project started coming to shape.

Lesson learned, a good plan at the beginning is the most important thing for a successful project.


It’s been three months and three weeks of learning to code!
