I cannot believe is almost the end of the bootcamp.
It was intense, a lot of informations in a short amount of time...
React was like the cherry on top,  no wonder  it was the last chapter. I will definitely  continue learning React and add  new features to my projects but know, looking back I realized that until I didn’t 
understand what state  and props are and the difference between them I couldn’t understand React.

So to recap here  :
 -a state is an object which allows components to create and manage their own data. Components cannot pass data with state, but they can create and manage it internally.State should not be modified directly, but it can be modified with a special method called setState( ).State is private (cannot be accessed from outside).

 -a prop Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a component that is receiving it from outside.Props can only be passed from parent component to child (unidirectional flow).
 
 It’s been 7 months of learning to code.
